# Dynamic Orchestration Template

A "one-size-fits-all" template for orchestration scripts.

If credentials.py file is missing from directory, create the file and add the following dictionary.

```python

credentials = {
    "user": "admin",
    "password": "admin",
    "domain": "Global",
    "server": "localhost"
}

```
